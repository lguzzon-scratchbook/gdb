# GenosDB Roadmap

[](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb)

Welcome to the roadmap for **GenosDB**, a decentralized P2P graph database powering modern Web3 applications, including our 3D metaverse built with Babylon.js. This document outlines our vision and next steps. Share your feedback in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/discussions)!

## Vision

To empower developers to build secure, real-time decentralized applications—from chats and Kanban boards to immersive 3D metaverses—without relying on centralized servers, with a simple API and a focus on security and performance.

## Current Status (Stable Beta)

As of today, GenosDB is in a stable beta phase, offering a robust set of features for building decentralized applications.

-   **Key Features**:
    -   Graph database with `put`, `get`, `link`, `map`, `remove` operations ([See details](https://medium.com/genosdb/genosdb-distributed-graph-based-database-7f03b878507b)).
    -   Recursive graph traversal with the `$edge` operator for complex queries ([See article](https://medium.com/genosdb/introducing-recursive-graph-traversal-queries-in-genosdb-7a2eff62c5bf)).
    -   GenosRTC: P2P streaming for real-time audio, video, and file transfers.
    -   Cellular Mesh architecture for horizontal scaling to large-scale networks.
    -   Advanced Security Module: Featuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), WebAuthn biometric authentication, and a solution to the Distributed Trust Paradox ([See RBAC](https://medium.com/genosdb/role-based-access-control-rbac-in-genosdb-bde218a1a0df), [See Trust Paradox](https://medium.com/genosdb/how-genosdb-solved-the-distributed-trust-paradox-a-guide-to-p2p-security-a552aa3e3318)).
    -   Intelligent Delta Synchronization via an oplog, compressed payloads, full-state fallback, and signaling over the Nostr network for maximum efficiency ([See article](https://medium.com/genosdb/genosdb-v0-4-0-introducing-oplog-driven-intelligent-delta-sync-and-full-state-fallback-741fe8ff132c)).
    -   High-performance asynchronous engine capable of handling tens of thousands of writes per second ([See article](https://medium.com/genosdb/genosdbs-new-async-engine-unlocking-unparalleled-performance-and-simplicity-in-a-real-time-c666f1a9a5d2)).
    -   Flagship Use Case: A 3D metaverse built with Babylon.js, using GenosDB for avatar sync, chat, and object management ([OVGrid](https://ovgrid.com)).
-   **Availability**: Free, minified builds are available via NPM and CDN for immediate use ([Repo](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb)).
-   **Demos & Tutorials**: A rich collection of practical examples, including real-time chats, to-do lists, and Kanban boards ([See all tutorials](https://medium.com/genosdb)).
-   **Limitations**: The API is stable but may undergo minor changes before v1.0. The source code is private to protect IP, while the builds remain free to use.

## Achievements (Historical Milestones)

Based on our [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), here are key features and enhancements that have shaped GenosDB's evolution. *(Note: Please adjust dates to reflect reality.)*
