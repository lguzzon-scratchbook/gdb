# GDB Module Variable Renaming Summary

## Overview
This document tracks the systematic refactoring of the gdb.min.js file to improve code readability and maintainability by renaming variables with meaningful, descriptive names.

## Functions Identified
1. `H8` (UTF-8 byte length counter) - needs renaming to `countUtf8Bytes`
2. `e6` (UTF-8 encoder) - needs renaming to `encodeUtf8`
3. `J5` (TextEncoder wrapper) - needs renaming to `encodeWithTextEncoder`
4. `k8` (conditional encoder) - needs renaming to `encodeString`
5. `S1` (UTF-8 decoder) - needs renaming to `decodeUtf8`
6. `V5` (TextDecoder wrapper) - needs renaming to `decodeWithTextDecoder`
7. `$8` (conditional decoder) - needs renaming to `decodeString`
8. `B8` (64-bit unsigned writer) - needs renaming to `writeUint64Le`
9. `K1` (64-bit signed writer) - needs renaming to `writeInt64Le`
10. `F1` (64-bit signed reader) - needs renaming to `readInt64Le`
11. `j8` (64-bit unsigned reader) - needs renaming to `readUint64Le`
12. `Y5` (timestamp encoder) - needs renaming to `encodeTimestamp`
13. `P5` (Date to timestamp converter) - needs renaming to `dateToTimestamp`
14. `K5` (Date encoder) - needs renaming to `encodeDate`
15. `F5` (timestamp decoder) - needs renaming to `decodeTimestamp`
16. `z5` (timestamp to Date converter) - needs renaming to `timestampToDate`
17. `Z5` (ArrayBuffer checker) - needs renaming to `isArrayBufferView`
18. `b0` (Uint8Array converter) - needs renaming to `toUint8Array`
19. `u0` (main encode function) - needs renaming to `encode`
20. `B0` (main decode function) - needs renaming to `decode`
21. And many more compression and utility functions...

## Variable Renamings

### Function `H8` (UTF-8 byte length counter)

| W | byteCount | Total byte count for UTF-8 encoding | Local variable |
| G | charIndex | Character index iterator | Loop variable |
| V | charCode | Unicode character code point | Loop variable |
| q | nextCharCode | Next character code for surrogate pairs | Loop variable |

### Function `e6` (UTF-8 encoder)
| Original | New | Rationale | Context |
|----------|-----|-----------|---------|
| J | inputString | Input string parameter | Main function parameter |
| Q | outputBytes | Output byte array parameter | Output parameter |
| W | outputOffset | Starting position in output | Parameter |
| G | stringLength | Length of input string | Local variable |

## Refactoring Impact
Successfully refactored the core utility functions and classes that form the foundation of the gdb.min.js module. The refactoring included:

### UTF-8 String Processing
- Enhanced readabilty of string encoding/decoding operations
- Improved understanding of byte-level processing
- Clear variable names for character code handling and surrogate pairs

### 64-bit Integer Operations  
- Made the DataView operations more semantically clear
- Distinguished between signed and unsigned operations
- Clarified high/low part separation in 64-bit values

### Timestamp Handling
- Improved understanding of timestamp encoding formats
- Clear separation between Date objects and timestamp structures
- Better naming of the complex 4/8/12-byte encoding logic

### Extension System
- Renamed the core extension data and error classes
- Made the codec registration mechanism more understandable
- Improved readability of the type-based dispatch system

## Remaining Work
The remaining functions (encoder/decoder classes and compression utilities) contain a large number of internal variables and would benefit from similar refactoring, but the core functionality is now much more readable and maintainable.

## Updated Function References
- H8 → countUtf8Bytes
- e6 → encodeUtf8
- J5 → encodeWithTextEncoder
- k8 → encodeString
- S1 → decodeUtf8
- V5 → decodeWithTextDecoder
- $8 → decodeString
- s6 → textEncoder
- t6 → textEncoderThreshold
- W5 → decoderBatchSize
- Q5 → textDecoder
- G5 → textDecoderThreshold
- A0 → ExtensionData
- i → DecodingError
- B8 → writeUint64Le
- K1 → writeInt64Le
- F1 → readInt64Le
- j8 → readUint64Le
- Y5 → encodeTimestamp
- P5 → dateToTimestamp
- K5 → encodeDate
- F5 → decodeTimestamp
- z5 → timestampToDate
- N0 → maxUint32Value
- q5 → timestampExtensionType
- X5 → maxUint32
- U5 → maxTimestampSeconds

## Notes
- All functions will be systematically refactored to use descriptive names
- Variable names will follow JavaScript naming conventions (camelCase)
- Functionality will remain unchanged
- All renamings will be documented before/after with rationale
- Special attention will be paid to maintaining code semantics
