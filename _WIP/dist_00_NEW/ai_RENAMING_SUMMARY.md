# AI Module Refactoring Summary

This document tracks the refactoring of `/ai.min.js`, focusing on renaming variables to improve readability while preserving behavior. The work is performed function by function to maintain a clear audit trail.

## Function Task List

| Function (Original Name) | Description | Final Name | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `u(context)` | Initializes and caches the WebLLM engine inside the provided context. | `initializeWebLlmContext(environment)` | Completed |
| `a(context)` | Convenience wrapper that delegates to `u(context)` and is exported as `init`. | `initializeAi(environment)` | Completed |

All functions have been refactored. Details for every rename appear in the audit log below.

## Variable Rename Audit Log

Entries document the completed refactors. Each table lists the function context together with the before/after mappings and the rationale behind the new name choices.

### Function: `initializeWebLlmContext` (formerly `u`)

| Original Name | New Name | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `u` | `initializeWebLlmContext` | Communicates that the helper prepares and returns a context configured with WebLLM instead of hiding behind a single-letter name. |
| `i` | `webLlmSdk` | Makes the module import instantly recognizable as the WebLLM SDK rather than an opaque single-letter alias. |
| `f` | `environment` | Reflects that the argument is an environment or host object that receives the cached WebLLM instance. |
| `g` (parameter of `init`) | `modelIdentifier` | Clarifies that the optional argument chooses which model to load. |
| `g` (error in `catch`) | `initializationError` | Specifies that the error originates from the initialization flow, helping with downstream logging. |

### Function: `initializeAi` (formerly `a`)

| Original Name | New Name | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a` | `initializeAi` | Highlights that the exported helper initializes AI capabilities instead of masking intent with a single character. |
| `f` | `environment` | Keeps naming consistent with `initializeWebLlmContext`, making the wrapper's purpose immediately apparent. |
